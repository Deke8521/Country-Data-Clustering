This project involves applying a machine learning clustering algorithm to the dataset country_data.csv. 
The dataset contains various features related to countries such as child mortality, exports, health spending, etc. The objective is to investigate the dataset using clustering, analyze the results, and discuss the conclusions drawn from the clusters.  

# Project Objectives 
## Data Analysis and Preprocessing: 
Load and explore the country_data.csv dataset. Handle missing values and perform data cleaning. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships of the features. 

## Clustering:  
Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means) to group the countries into clusters. Use as many features as possible to observe how the clustering changes with different feature sets. 

## Cluster Visualization:  
Visualize the clusters to understand the grouping of data points and the characteristics of each cluster.

## Cluster Analysis:  
Analyze the results and discuss what can be concluded from the clusters. Provide insights and advice based on the clustering results within the context of the dataset.
